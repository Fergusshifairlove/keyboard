KeyboardFX

Screen keyboard control for JavaFX 8

This project uses Maven to manage dependencies, build and package. 

Although it is possible to build JavaFX 2 project with Maven, it requires working around the fact that JavaFX 2 isn't by default on Classpath in JDK 1.7. 

Mentioned issue is solved in JDK 1.8 and JavaFX 8 which are in Early Access state as of 8 of Ocrober, 2013.
